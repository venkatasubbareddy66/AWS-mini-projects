--  take snapsot of EBS volume (or safe) 

-- increase EBS volume Size in AWS Console -- select volume --> actions --> moify volume 

it will take some time to change , here no need to stop ec2 

if u do  df -hT u can see 8GiB only but in console it is showing more (u jst modified) 

-- so do extend 

-- Extend a linux File system after resizing a volume 

-- follow some cmnds to extend the linux file system 

-- check if any partition 

sudo lsblk 

-- Extend the partition 

sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

1 = first partition 


-- do

sudo lsblk 

-- do df -hT 

u can still see the 8 GiB only so u an do 

make a note f file system u are using 

-- if u are usinf (XFS file system ) 

sudo xfs_growfs -d /

-- do df -hT  u can able to see 20gb 

-- [Ext4 file system]: 

sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1



this is how u can change size of volume without stopping ur ec2

-- create one ec2 ubuntu instance 

-- First, update the default Ubuntu packages lists for upgrades with the following command:

sudo apt-get update


-- Then, run the following command to install JDK 11:

sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk


-- Now, we will install Jenkins itself. Issue the following four commands in sequence to initiate the installation from the Jenkins repository:

-- paste all at once 


curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install jenkins


-- Once that’s done, start the Jenkins service with the following command:

sudo systemctl start jenkins.service


-- To confirm its status, use:

sudo systemctl status jenkins



--- With Jenkins installed, we can proceed with adjusting the firewall settings. By default, Jenkins will run on port 8080.

In order to ensure that this port is accessible, we will need to configure the built-in Ubuntu firewall (ufw). To open the 8080 port and enable the firewall, use the following commands:



sudo ufw allow 8080


sudo ufw enable


-- Once done, test whether the firewall is active using this command:


sudo ufw status


-- With the firewall configured, it’s time to set up Jenkins itself. Type in the IP of your EC2 along with the port number. The Jenkins setup wizard will open.

To check the initial password, use the cat command as indicated below:


sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword



-- All Set! You can now start automating...
